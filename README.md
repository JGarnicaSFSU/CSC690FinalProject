PROPOSAL: A small app that allows a user to search an defined area for food. It is designed for when you are in an area walking for example
and want to be more specific about your search for food. Google Maps or Apple Maps along with Yelp do not have a distance parameter
which is really frustrating if you do not want to walk far or want only search for a given along with other parameters.


Must-have features:
-Search by Area. (1-3 Hours)
-Be Able to get directions. (1 Hour)
-Order by price and reviews. (2 Hours)
-See details about the place (3 Hours)
-Have a useable UI. (4 Hours)

Nice-to-have features:
-Save the place somewhere
-Have the search function have even more parameters.
